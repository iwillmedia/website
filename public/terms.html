      <div class="meta">Last updated: January 30, 2026</div>

      <div class="copy">
        <div class="block">
          These Terms &amp; Conditions apply to all services provided by IWILL MEDIA, including
          AI voice agents, AI chatbots, automation tools, trial services, and ongoing subscriptions.
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <div class="heading">1. About Our Services</div>
          IWILL MEDIA provides AI-powered tools and services designed to assist businesses with handling enquiries,
          capturing contact details, and automating routine interactions.
          <ul class="list">
            <li>AI Voice Receptionists</li>
            <li>AI Chatbots</li>
            <li>AI Agents</li>
            <li>Automation and workflow services</li>
            <li>Trial, test, or pilot services</li>
            <li>Ongoing subscription services</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <div class="heading">2. Trial &amp; Test Services (Including 14-Day Trials)</div>
          Where a service is offered as a trial or test period, it is provided on a limited, evaluation-only basis.
          During a trial period, services are generally limited to:
          <ul class="list">
            <li>Answering calls or messages</li>
            <li>Capturing caller or user contact details</li>
            <li>Recording the caller’s or user’s issue or request</li>
            <li>Forwarding captured information to the Client or nominated contact</li>
          </ul>
          Trial services do not include full customer service, sales, advice, bookings, or complex support unless expressly agreed in writing.
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <div class="heading">3. Client Responsibilities</div>
          The Client agrees to provide accurate setup information, a monitored contact method, and timely responses to captured enquiries.
          I WILL MEDIA is not responsible for delays or outcomes caused by inaccurate, incomplete, or late information supplied by the Client.
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <div class="heading">4. Service Availability &amp; Completion</div>
          A trial or test service is considered complete at the end of the stated trial period, regardless of call volume, enquiry volume, or usage.
          Service availability may be affected by third-party platforms, telecommunications providers, internet connectivity, or systems outside the control of I WILL MEDIA.
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <div class="heading">5. No Performance Guarantees</div>
          Our services are provided on a best-effort basis. To the extent permitted by law, I WILL MEDIA does not guarantee call or message volumes,
          lead quality, conversion rates, revenue or business outcomes, or continuous or uninterrupted service.
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <div class="heading">6. Fees &amp; Payments</div>
          Trial and setup fees are one-off and non-refundable, except where required under Australian Consumer Law. Subscription fees (where applicable)
          are billed separately. No recurring charges apply unless the Client explicitly agrees to continue beyond a trial or test period.
          Failure to pay applicable fees may result in suspension or termination of services.
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <div class="heading">7. Transition to Ongoing Services</div>
          If the Client chooses to continue using a service after a trial period, a separate subscription or ongoing service agreement will apply.
          If the Client does not proceed, the service will be discontinued at the end of the trial period without further obligation.
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <div class="heading">8. Ownership &amp; Intellectual Property</div>
          All AI configurations, workflows, prompts, system designs, and supporting materials remain the intellectual property of I WILL MEDIA.
          The Client is granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the services while the service is active and payments are up to date.
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <div class="heading">9. Limitation of Liability</div>
          To the maximum extent permitted by law, I WILL MEDIA is not liable for indirect or consequential loss, loss of profits, revenue, or business opportunity,
          missed calls, messages, or enquiries, or delays or interruptions caused by third-party systems.
          Nothing in these Terms excludes, restricts, or modifies any rights or remedies the Client may have under Australian Consumer Law.
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <div class="heading">10. Australian Consumer Law Notice</div>
          Our services come with guarantees that cannot be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law. You are entitled to a replacement or refund for a major failure,
          and compensation for any other reasonably foreseeable loss or damage. Nothing in these Terms limits your rights under the Australian Consumer Law.
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <div class="heading">11. Suspension &amp; Termination</div>
          I WILL MEDIA may suspend or terminate services if these Terms are breached, services are misused or used unlawfully, or required payments are not made.
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <div class="heading">12. Changes to Services or Terms</div>
          We may update our services or these Terms from time to time. The latest version will be published on our website.
          Continued use of our services constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <div class="heading">13. Acceptance</div>
          By using any I WILL MEDIA service — including payment of trial, setup, or subscription fees — the Client acknowledges they have read and agree to these Terms &amp; Conditions as of January 30, 2026.
